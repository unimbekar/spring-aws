## About the Book

This comprehensive book teaches everything you need to know to get your Spring Boot application into production with AWS.

Throughout the book, we incrementally build a real-world Spring Boot application with a focus on the following topics:

**Infrastructure As Code**:

Say goodbye to long and hard-to-maintain CloudFormation YAML files. We're using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) and Java to express our infrastructure needs.

**Integrate Various AWS Services**:

We integrate various AWS services by implementing features for the sample application. You'll learn how to bootstrap, work with, and integrate: Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL), Amazon ECS (Fargate), Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon Cognito, Amazon MQ, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, etc.

**Automated Deployment**:

We start right from the beginning with an automated CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) to get our changes deployed to production in a matter of minutes.

**Seamless Operation**:

We don't stop here. Once our application is running in production, things are getting serious. You'll learn how to monitor and operate a Spring Boot application in production effectively.
